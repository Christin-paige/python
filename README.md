## The Python Recipe App

#### This application will be built using Python and with the Django framework.

* This is the Command Line version - nothing fancy...yet
* User recipes are created and managed on a locally hosted MySQL database
* User will be able to create and search for recipes
* Recipes will be rated based on difficulty
* When user prompts, more information will be displayed about the recipe

#### This is what I have learned/completed so far (updated after each exercise).

* Python has been successfully installed
* I created and managed virtual environments
* I used pip to install and manage packages (math, bcryt, ipython)
* Implemented conditional statements, loops, and functions to build my recipe app in the command line.
* Used MySQL to store the recipes into a database with the functionality of creating a recipe, updating a recipe, searching for a recipe containing a specific ingredient, and deleting recipes.
